closeClaw:
	pull piston in, keep pressure on piston to keep claw closed

openClaw:
	push piston out, keep pressure on piston to keep claw closed

NOTE: for closeClaw and openClaw, current command must persist until other one called. So isFinished() must always return false.

clawUp(int n):
	look up  current level of claw
	get distance to level n
	wind winch to bring claw up to level n for t seconds
		compute time required and power required
		activate winch
		PID loop?
	check height with sensor, use sensors for fine control as time approaches t 
		time to get to general area (lower bound)
		PID / sensor to get accurate height
	allow for human override
	limit switch at top and bottom 

clawDown(n):
	get current level of claw
	get distance to level n
	wind winch to bring claw up to level n for t seconds
	check height with sensor, use sensors for fine control as time approaches t
	allow for human override
	limit switch at top and bottom 

pickUpNewBin(n): // must input which level to pick up from... may want to leave 1st bin on the floor for chute
	if holdingBins:
		placeOnStack(numBins)
	else:
		openClaw
	Precise align robot with new bin
	clawDown to level n
	closeClaw
	clawUp to level n + 0.5? -- bins off the floor


placeOnStack(n):
	clawUp to n + 1 + 0.5
	Precise align with existing stack
	clawDown to n + 1
	clawOpen, release held stack
